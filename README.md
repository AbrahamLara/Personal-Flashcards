## Personal Flashcards
This is my project for Udacity's React Native course. This mobile app allows users to create decks of flashcards to quiz themselves on whatever topics they wish. After creating a deck they can add cards to it with their own questions and answers. The user also has the ability to quiz themselves on each deck. They can view the answer to a card and switch back to viewing the question and if their guess was correct they tap the _correct_, but if it was incorrect they tap the _incorrect_ button and after answer all the questions they see the percentage of questions they got correct and see a list of questions they got incorrect. To delete a deck simply long press on a deck to get an alert confirmation.

Other features include getting notifications to study.
