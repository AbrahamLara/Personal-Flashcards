## Personal Flashcards
Currently a work in progress!
<br/>
This is my project for Udacity's React Native course. This mobile app allows users to create decks of flashcards to quiz themselves on whatever they wish.
After creating a deck they can add cards to it and quiz themselves

## Setup
If you wish to use this app yourself you will need to download the expo app first on you mobile store.

Or if you want to run the app on an iOS or Android Emulator follow these steps:
<br/>
___Note to self: write instructions___

install dependencies: `yarn add`
start development server: `yarn start`

Open up the expo app and click on the running server.
